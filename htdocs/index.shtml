		<h1>fb-contrib&trade;: A FindBugs&trade; auxiliary detector plugin</h1>
	
		<p>fb-contrib&trade; is an extra detector plugin to be used with the static bug
		finder FindBugs&trade; (findbugs.sourceforge.net). Just download the fb-contrib.jar
		file, and place it in the appropriate location based on how you wish to use it. (See below). FindBugs&trade; will
		automatically pick up the jar file, and incorporate these detectors with its
		own.

			fb-contrib can be used from the Findbugs&trade; Gui, Ant, or the eclipse plugin.<br/>
			<ul>
			<li style="margin-left: -10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">
				To run fb-contrib from the gui, or ant, just place the fb-contrib jar in the plugins directory inside of the
				Findbugs&trade; directory.
			</li>
			<li style="margin-left: -10px;">
				To run fb-contrib from eclipse, assuming that the main FindBugs plugin is installed, 
				simply drop the fb-contrib.jar in the plugins directory of eclipse, and restart eclipse.
			</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p style="font-weight: bold;">The latest version of fb-contrib is 6.6.0 available for download 
		<a href="http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22fb-contrib%22">here</a>.</p>

                <li><b>[STB] Stacked Try Blocks</b><br/>
                Looks for two or more try catch blocks that are consecutive and catch the
                same kind of exception, and throw the same exception always. These blocks can
                be coalesced into one.
                </li>
                <li><b>[JPAI] JPA Issues</b><br/>
                Looks for various issues around the use of the Java Persistence API (JPA), including
                with use with spring-tx.
                </li>
                <li><b>[SEO] Suboptimal Expression Order</b><br/>
                Looks for conditional expressions where both simple local variable (in)equalities are used
				along with method calls, where the method calls are done first. By placing the simple local 
				checks first, you eliminate potentially costly calls in some cases. This assumes that the methods
				called won't have side-effects that are desired. At present it only looks for simple sequences
				of 'and' based conditions.
				</li>
				<li><b>[IOI] IO Issues</b><br/>
				looks for various issues around input/output/streaming Library use.

        		<li><b>[OPM] Overly Permissive Method</b><br/>
    		    Looks for methods that are declared more permissively than the code is using. For instance, declaring
    			a method public, when it could just be declared private.
    			</li>
    			<li><b>[STT] Stringified Types</b><br/>
    			Looks for string fields that appear to be built with parsing or calling
                toString() on another object, or from objects that are fields.
                </li>
                <li><b>[IMC] Immature Class</b><br/>
    			Looks for classes that are not fully implemented to be a well rounded class. While
    			the class will likely work fine, it is more difficult to use or understand than necessary.
                </li>
                <li><b>[JXI] JAX-RS Issues</b><br/>
                Looks for problems with the use of the JAX-RS specification.

                </li>
                <li><b>[CBC] Contains based Conditional</b><br/>
                Looks for complex if expressions made up of multiple conditions joined by OR, whereit is much cleaner
    		    to build a static set of the possible values, and use the contains method on that set.
    		    </li>
   				<li><b>[SLS] Suspicious Loop Search</b><br/>
    			Looks for loops where an equality check is made and a variable is set because of it.
				It would seem once the item is found, the loop can be terminated, but is not.
                </li>    			
				<li><b>[CRF] Conflating Resources and Files</b><br/>
    			Looks for code that uses the File api on URI/URLs where the reference is not a file based one.
				In the case of classpath URIs, this may work if the classpath is resolving to a folder, but will
				fall for jar files.

                Looks for methods that create and populate collections, and while knowing
                the end size of those collections, does not pre allocate the collection
                to be big enough. This just causes unneeded reallocations putting strain
                on the garbage collector.
                </li>
                <li><b>[AIOB] Array Index Out of Bounds</b><br/>
                Looks for questionable load/stores to array elements.
                	<ul>
                    <li>
                    Looks for accesses to array elements using literal values that are known to be outside the bounds of the array.
                    This mistake will cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException to occur at runtime.</li>
                    <li>
                    Looks for stores to array elements where the array itself appears to have not been allocated.

                <li><b>[UJM] Unjitable Methods</b><br/>
                Looks for methods that are too big that the JIT will not compile them no matter how often they are run
                </li>
                <li><b>[HE] Hanging Executors</b><br/>
                Looks for executors that are never shutdown, which will not allow the application to terminate<br/>

                <li><b>[CTU] Conflicting Time Units</b><br/>
                Looks for methods that perform arithmetic operations on values representing time
				where the time unit is incompatible, i.e. adding a millisecond value to a nanosecond value.
				</li>
				<li><b>[HCP] HttpClient Problems</b><br/>
				The HttpRequests from the apache.httpComponents have some little-known quirks about them.  
				This is a set of detectors that helps guard against resource starvation.<br/>

            <ul>
        		<li><b>[CNC] Collection Naming Confusion</b><br/>
        		Looks for fields and local variables that have Map, Set, List in their names
                but the variable is a collection of a different basic type.
                </li>
                <li><b>[PME] Poor Mans Enum</b><br/>
                Looks for simple fields that only store one of several constant values. This usually is an indication 
                that this field should really be an enum type.
                </li>
                <li><b>[UP] Unused Parameter</b><br/>
                Looks for private or static methods that have parameters that aren't used. These parameters
                can be removed.
                </li>
                <li><b>[CD] Circular Dependencies</b><br/>
                Looks for class dependencies that where two or more classes rely on each other, either directly or indirectly.
                This often signifies an improper data model. Consider using interfaces to break this closed loop.
                </li>
                <li><b>[MUC] Modifying Unmodifiable Collection</b><br/>
                Looks for code that attempts to modify a collection that is or may be
                defined as immutable. for instance, being returned from Arrays.asList(). Doing so will cause exceptions at runtime.

            <li><b>[CVAA] ContraVariant Array Assignment</b><br/>
            Looks for contravariant array assignments. Since arrays are mutable data structures, their use 
            must be restricted to covariant or invariant usage.<br/>
            <span style="color: #0000FF;">--contributed by Bhaskar Maddala - THANKS!</span>
            </li>
            <li><b>[CAAL] Confusing Array As List</b><br/>
            Looks for calls to Arrays.asList where the parameter is a primitive array.
            This does not produce a list that holds the primitive boxed value, but a list of
            one item, the array itself.
            </li>
            <li><b>[UMTP] Unbound Method Template Parameter</b><br/>
            Looks for methods that declare method level template parameter(s) that are not bound to any of 
            the method's parameters, and thus is not adding any validation/type safety to the method, 
            and is just confusing.
            </li>
             <li><b>[NPMC] Non Productive Method Call</b><br/>
            Looks for common methods that are believed to be non mutating, where the value
            is discarded. Since the method makes no changes to the object, calling this method
            is useless. The method call can be removed.
            </li>
            <li><b>[ICA] Invalid Constant Argument</b><br/>
            Looks for passing invalid constant arguments to some well known methods that expect an enum-like
            value. However these JDK methods were created before the introduction of enums and thus used simple int 
            constants. Passing an invalid value will cause exceptions to occur.

				<li><b>[LGO] Lingering Graphics Object</b><br/>
				Looks for creation of java.awt.Graphics object that do not have the
				.dispose() method called on them when finished. These objects will be cleaned up by 
				the Garbage collector, bug given the likelyhood that large numbers of these objects can
				be created in a short period of time, it is better to dispose them as soon as possible.</li>
				<li><b>[CCNE] Compare Class Name Equals</b><br/>
				Looks for code that compares two classes by name, rather than by just comparing the
				classes with ==<br/>
				<span style="color: #0000FF;">--contributed by Bhaskar Maddala - THANKS!</span>
				</li>
				<li><b>[CSBTS] CommonsStringBuilderToString</b><br/>
				Looks for usage of ToStringBuilder from Apache commons, where the code invokes
				toString() on the constructed object without invoking append().<br/>
 
				Usage without invoking append is equivalent of using the Object.toString()
				method

				<pre>
		new ToStringBuilder(this).toString();

				</li>
				<li><b>[CHTH] CommonsHashcodeBuilderToHashcode</b><br/>

				returned instead of calling the method toHashCode().<br/>
				<span style="color: #0000FF;">--contributed by Bhaskar Maddala - THANKS!</span>
				</li>
				<li><b>[BRPI] BackportReusePublicIdentifiers</b><br/>
				Looks for use of Backport Utils concurrent classes. Updated/Efficient version of these
            			classes are available in versions of the JDK 5.0 and higher, and these
            			classes should only be used if you are targeting JDK 1.4 and lower.<br/>

				</li>
				<li><b>[CU] Clone Usability</b><br/>
				Looks for classes that implement clone() that do not specialize the return value, and do
                not swallow CloneNotSupportedException. Not doing so makes the clone method not as simple
                to use, and should be harmless to do.

			<ul>
				<li><b>[SNG] Suspicious Null Guard</b><br/>
				Looks for code that checks to see if a field or local variable is not null 
				before entering a code block either an if, or while statement, and reassigns
				that field or variable. It seems that perhaps the guard should check if the field
				or variable is null.</li>
				<li><b>[PUS] Possible Unsuspected Serialization</b><br/>
				Looks for serialization of non-static inner classes. As this serializes
				the enclosing class, it may unintentionally bring in more to the serialization
				than is wanted.</li>
				<li><b>[SEC] Side Effect Constructor</b><br/>
				Looks for constructors that operate through side effects, specifically
				constructors that aren't assigned to any variable or field. This makes
				the code more difficult to maintain as it has a tendency to increase cohesion
				between classes.
				</li>
				<li><b>[SGSU] Suspicious Getter Setter Use</b><br/>
				Looks for the setting of a java bean property with a value retrieved from the same
				bean's getter method for that property. This is usually a copy/paste typo.

			<ul>
				<li><b>[ROOM] Reflection on Object Methods</b><br/>
				Looks for method calls through reflection on methods found in java.lang.Object. 
				As these methods are always available, there's no reason to do this.</li>
				<li><b>[IPU] Improper Properties Use</b><br/>
				Looks for java.util.Properties use where values other than String are placed in 
				the properties object. As the Properties object was intended to be a String to 
				String only collection, putting other types in the Properties object is incorrect, 
				and takes advantage of a poor design decision by the original Properties class 
				designers to derive from Hashtable, rather than using aggregation.</li>
				<li><b>[PCAIL] Possible Constant Allocation in Loop</b><br/>
				Looks for allocations of objects using the default constructor in a loop, where
	 			the object allocated is never assigned to any object that is used outside the loop.
	 			It is possible that this allocation can be done outside the loop to avoid excessive garbage.</li>
				<li><b>[WOC] Write Only Collection</b><br/>
				Looks for allocations and initializations of java collections, but that are never
	 			read from or accessed to gain information. This represents a collection of no use, and most probably
	 			can be removed. It is similar to a dead local store.</li>
	 			<li><b>[UVA] Use Var Args</b><br/>
	 			Looks for definitions of methods that have an array as the last parameter.
	 			Since this class is compiled with java 1.5 or better, it would be more flexible for clients of this
	 			method to define this parameter as a vararg parameter.</li>

			<ul>
				<li><b>[PDP] Poorly Defined Parameter</b><br/>
				Looks for non derivable methods that declare parameters and then cast those
				parameters to more specific types in the method. This is misleading and dangerous
				as you are not documenting through parameter types what is necessary for these
				parameters to function correctly.</li>
				<li><b>[OC] Overzealous Casting</b><br/>
				Looks for manual casts of objects that are more specific then needed as the value is assigned
				to a class or interface higher up in the inheritance chain. You only need to cast to that class
				or interface.</li>
				<li><b>[IKNC] Inconsistent Key Name Casing</b><br/>
				Looks for calls to HttpRequest.getParameter and HttpRequest.getAttribute with parameters 
				of the same name with different cases like 'id' and 'Id'.</li>
				<li><b>[NSE] Non Symmetric Equals</b><br/>
				Looks for classes that break the fundamental rule of equivalence, which is
				symmetry. If a equals b, then b equals a. While it is usually wrong to allow
				equals to compare different types, at the very least you should make sure that
				each class knows about each other and is able to compare themselves with each other.</li>
				<li><b>[NFF] Non Functional Field</b><br/>
				Looks for fields in serializable classes that are defined as both final and
				transient. As a transient field is not initialized when streamed, and is not 
				initialized in a constructor, it will remain null because it is defined final.</li>
				<li><b>[MDM] More Dumb Methods</b><br/>
				Looks for a variety of questionable method calls that will cause problems, are unsafe
				or use practices that might lead to bugs.

				<li><b>[TBP] Tristate Boolean Pattern</b><br/>
				Looks for methods that are defined to return Boolean, but return null. This thus
				allows three return values, Boolean.FALSE, Boolean.TRUE and null. If three values are
				intended, it would be more clear to just create an enumeration with three values
				and return that type.</li>
				<li><b>[SUA] Suspicious Uninitialized Array</b><br/>
				Looks for creation of arrays, that are not populated before being returned
				for a method. While it is possible that the method that called this method
				will do the work of populated the array, it seems odd that this would be the case.</li>
				<li><b>[ITU] Inappropriate ToString Use</b><br/>
				Looks for methods that rely on the format of the string fetched from another object's toString
				method, when that method appears not to be owned by the author of the calling method.
				As the implementation of toString() is often considered a private implementation detail of a class, 
				and not something that should be relied on, depending on its format is dangerous.</li>
				<li><b>[BED] Bogus Exception Declaration</b><br/>
				Looks for constructors, private methods or static methods that declare that they
				throw specific checked exceptions, but that do not. This just causes callers of 
				these methods to do extra work to handle an exception that will never be thrown.</li>
				<li><b>[DTEP] Deprecated Typesafe Enum Pattern</b><br/>
				Looks for classes that appear to implement the old style type safe enum pattern 
				that was used before java added Enum support to the language. Since this class is 
				compiled with java 1.5 or later, it would be simpler to just use java enums.</li>
				<li><b>[UNNC] Unnecessary New Null Check</b><br/>
				Looks for construction of new objects, and then the immediate testing
				whether the object is null or not. As the new operator will always succeed,
				or through an exception, this test is unnecessary and represents a misunderstanding
				as to how the jvm works.</li>

			<ul>
				<li><b>[DSOC] Dubious Set of Collections</b><br/>
				Looks for sets or keySets of maps that contain other collections. As typically collections calculate
				their hashCode, equals and compareTo methods by iterating the collection and evaluating the same function
				on each item in the collection, this can be costly from a performance point of view.
				In addition, using a set, or keySet of a map, infers that you will be looking for items based on 
				the value of a collection, which seems dubious at best.
				Finally, as collections are often modified, This may cause problems if the collection is modified,
				thus changing hashCodes, etc, while the collection is in the set.
				If you wish to keep a collection of collections, the outer collection should probably be a list
				to avoid these problems</li>
				<li><b>[IICU] Incorrect Internal Class Use</b><br/>
				Looks for classes that use objects from internal sun, xerces or xalan packages. As these are internal
				to the respective products and subject to change or removal, these should not be used.</li>
				<li><b>[LO] Logger Oddities</b><br/>
				Looks for uses of log4j or slf4j where the class specified when creating the logger
				is not the same as the class in which this logger is used. Also looks for using concatenation
                with slf4j logging rather than using the parameterized interface.</li>
				<li><b>[SCSS] Suspicious Clustered Session Support</b><br/>
				Looks for methods that access objects in http sessions, that are complex objects,
				modifies those objects, but does not call setAttribute to signify a change so that
				cluster replication can happens correctly.</li>

			<ul>
				<li><b>[CFS] Confusing Function Semantics</b><br/>
				Looks for methods that return a parameter after making what looks like
				modifications to that parameter. This leads to confusion for the user of this
				method as it isn't obvious that the 'original' object is modified. If the
				point of this method is to modify the parameter, it is probably better just
				to have the method be a void method, to avoid confusion.</li>
				<li><b>[SCA] Suspicious Clone Algorithm</b><br/>
				Looks for implementation of clone where an assignment is made to a field of the
				source object. It is likely that that store should have occurred on the cloned object, as
				the clone operation is almost always considered read only.</li>
				<li><b>[UTAO] Unit Test Assertion Oddities</b><br/>
				Looks for junit or testng test case methods that use assertions with odd parameters. Things such as,
				passing a constant as the second (actual) parameter, not using the three parameter version of 
				asserts for doubles, or passing true or false as the first parameter instead of using assertTrue, 
				or assertFalse.</li>
				<li><b>[WEM] Weak Exception Messaging</b><br/>
				Looks for exceptions that are thrown with static strings as messages. Using static strings
				doesn't differentiate one use of this method versus another, and so it may be difficult
				to determine how this exception occurred without showing context.</li>

			<ul>
				<li><b>[SJVU] Suspicious JDK Version Use</b><br/>
				Looks for calls to classes and methods that do not exist in the JDK for which this class is
				compiled. This can happen if you specify the -source and -target options of the javac compiler, and
				specify a target that is less than the jdk version of the javac compiler.</li>
				<li><b>[UAA] Use Add All</b><br/>
				Looks for loops that transfers the contents of one collection to another. These collection sources
				might be local variables or member fields, including sets, maps key/values, lists, or arrays. 
				It is simpler to just use the addAll method of the collection class. In the case where the 
				source is an array, you can use Arrays.asList(array), and use that as the source to addAll.</li>
				<li><b>[MRC] Method returns Constant</b><br/>
				Looks for private methods that can only return one constant value. 
				Either the class should not return a value, or perhaps a branch was missed.</li>
				<li><b>[NCS] Needless Custom Serialization</b><br/>
				Looks for classes that implement Serializable and implements readObject and writeObject
 				by just calling the readDefaultObject or writeDefaultObject of the stream parameter.
 				As this is the standard behavior, implementing these methods is not needed.</li>
 				<li><b>[EXS] Exception Softening</b><br/>
 				Looks for methods that catch checked exceptions, and throw unchecked exceptions in their 
 				place. There are several levels of concern. Least important are methods constrained by 
 				interface or super class contracts not to throw checked exceptions but appear owned by 
 				the same author. Next are methods constrained by interface or super class contracts and 
 				throw other types of checked exceptions. Lastly are method not constrained by any interface
 				or superclass contract.<br/>

				<li><b>[SCRV] Suspicious Comparator Return Values</b><br/>
				Looks for classes that implement Comparator or Comparable, and whose compare or compareTo
 				methods return constant values only, but that don't represent the three possible choices
				(a negative number, 0, and a positive number).</li>
				<li><b>[SPP] Sillyness Pot Pourri</b><br/>
				Looks for various small problems that don't fall into any particular category.</li>
				<li><b>[SCII] Spoiled Child Interface Implementor</b><br/>
				Looks for classes that implement interfaces by relying on methods being 
				implemented in superclasses, even though the superclass knows nothing about
				the interface being implemented by the child.</li>
				<li><b>[DWI] Deleting While Iterating</b><br/>
				Looks for deletion of items from a collection using the remove method
				of the collection at the same time that the collection is being iterated on. If
				this occurs the iterator will become invalid and throw a ConcurrentModificationException.
				Instead, the remove should be called on the iterator itself.</li>
				<li><b>[USS] Use String Split</b><br/>
				Looks for code that builds an array by using a StringTokenizer to break up
				a string and place individual elements into an array. It is simpler to use
				String.split instead.</li>

			<ul>
				<li><b>[LEST] Lost Exception Stack Trace</b><br/>
				Looks for methods that catch exceptions, and rethrow another exception without encapsulating
				the original exception within it. Doing this loses the stack history, and where the original
 				problem occurred. This makes finding and fixing errors difficult.</li>
				<li><b>[UCPM] Use Character Parameterized Method</b><br/>
				Looks for methods that pass single character string constants as parameters to 
				methods that alternatively have an overridden method that accepts a character instead.
				It is easier for the method to handle a single character than a String.</li>
				<li><b>[TR] Tail Recursion</b><br/>
				Looks for methods that make a recursive call to itself as the last statement in 
				the method. This tail recursion could be converted into a simple loop which would 
				improve the performance and stack requirements.</li>
				<li><b>[URV] Unrelated Return Values</b><br/>
				Looks for methods that return Object, and who's code body returns two or more
				different types of objects that are unrelated (other than by Object).</li>
				<li><b>[PIS] Possible Incomplete Serialization</b><br/>
				Looks for classes that don't handle serialization of parent class member fields 
				when the class in question is serializable but is derived from non serializable
				classes.<br/>

			<ul>
				<li><b>[NMCS] Needless Member Collection Synchronization</b><br/>
				Looks for private collection members, either static or instance, that are only initialized in
				the clinit or init, but are synchronized. This is not necessary as the constructor or static 
 				initializer are guaranteed to be thread safe.</li>
 				<li><b>[ITC] Inheritance Type Checking</b><br/>
 				Looks for if/else blocks where a series of them use instanceof on the same 
				variable to determine what to do. If these classes are related by inheritance,
				this often is better handled through calling a single overridden method.</li>
				<li><b>[PRMC] Possibly Redundant Method Calls</b><br/>
				Looks for calls of the same method on the same object when that object hasn't changed.
				This often is redundant, and the second call can be removed, or combined.</li>
				<li><b>[UTA] Use toArray</b><br/>
				Looks for code that builds an array of values from a collection, by manually looping
				over the elements of the collection, and adding them to the array. It is simpler and
				cleaner to use mycollection.toArray(new type[mycollection.size()].</li>

			<ul>
				<li><b>[FCBL] Field could be Local</b><br/>
				Looks for classes that declare fields that are used in a locals-only fashion, specifically private fields 
				that are accessed first in each method with a store vs. a load. These fields can be declared as one or more 
				locals.</li>
				<li><b>[NOS] Non Owned Synchronization</b><br/>
				Looks for methods that synchronize on variables that are not owned by the
				current class. Doing this causes confusion when two classes use the same variable
				for their own synchronization purposes. For cleanest separation of interests, only
				synchronize on private fields of the class. Note that 'this' is not owned by
				the current class and synchronization on 'this' should be avoided as well.</li>
				<li><b>[S508C] Section 508 Compliance</b><br/>
				Looks for classes and methods that do not support coding styles that allow Accessibility
				software to make full use of the gui for people with visual impediments. Commonly known as
				'Section 508 Compliance' this detector finds a varied list of issues that hamper screen readers,
				and make color/size adjustments difficult.</li>
				<li><b>[UEC] Use Enum Collections</b><br/>
				Looks for uses of sets or maps where the key is an enum. In these cases, it is 
				more efficient to use EnumSet or EnumMap. It is a jdk1.5 only detector.</li>

				This combination of two comparisons can be accomplished with just one comparison.</li>
				<li><b>[JVR] JDBC Vendor Reliance</b><br/>
				Looks for uses of jdbc vendor specific classes and methods making the database access code
				non portable.</li>
				<li><b>[PMB] Possible Memory Bloat</b><br/>
				Looks for classes that maintain collections or StringBuffer/StringBuilders in static member
				variables, and that do not appear to provide a way to clear or remove items from these members.
				Such class fields are likely causes of memory bloat.</li>
				<li><b>[LSYC] Local Synchronized Collection</b><br/>
				Looks for allocations of synchronized collections that are stored in local variables, and 
				never stored in fields or returned from methods. As local variables are by definition
				thread safe, using synchronized collections in this context makes no sense.</li>

			<ul>
				<li><b>[CLI] Constant List Index</b><br/>
				Looks for methods that access an array or list using a constant integer index. Often,
				this is a typo where a loop variable is intended to be used. If however, specific
				list indices mean different specific things, then perhaps replacing the list with
				a first-class object with meaningful accessors would make the code less brittle.</li>
				<li><b>[SCR] Sloppy Class Reflection</b><br/>
				Looks for methods that use Class.forName("XXX") to load a class object
				for a class that is already referenced by this class. It is simpler to just use
				XXX.class, and doing so protects the integrity of this code from such transformations
				as obfuscation. Use of Class.forName should only be used when the class in question
				isn't already statically bound to this context.</li>
				<li><b>[AWCBR] Array Wrapped Call By Reference</b><br/>
				Looks for methods that use an array of length one to pass a variable to achieve call
				by pointer ala C++. It is better to define a proper return class type that holds all
				the relevant information retrieved from the called method.</li>
				<li><b>[SG] Sluggish Gui</b><br/>
				Looks for methods that implement awt or swing listeners and perform time 
				consuming operations. Doing these operations in the gui thread will cause the
				interface to appear sluggish and non-responsive to the user. It is better to 
				use a separate thread to do the time consuming work so that the user
				has a better experience.</li>
				<li><b>[NIR] Needless Instance Retrieval</b><br/>
				Looks for methods that call a method to retrieve a reference to an object
				only to then load a static field of that object's class. It is simpler and more
				performant to just directly load the field from the class itself.</li>

			<ul>
				<li><b>[ABC] Array Based Collections</b><br/>
				Looks for methods that use arrays for items in the keyset of a map, or as
				an element of a set, or in a list when using the contains method. Since arrays
				do not, and cannot define an equals method, reference equality is used for these
				collections, which is probably not desired. If it is, consider using the IdentityHashMap
				class when using Maps in this case, to better document your intentions.</li>
				<li><b>[ODN] Orphaned DOM Nodes</b><br/>
				Looks for methods that create DOM nodes but do not append them to any Document.</li>
				<li><b>[A0M] Abstract Overridden Method</b><br/>
				Looks for abstract methods that override a concrete method in a super class.
				Doing this casts away the implementation of the super class, and breaks
				the implied contract as set forth by the parent class.</li>
				<li><b>[CBX] Custom Built XML</b><br/>
				Looks for methods that build xml based strings by concatenation strings
				and custom values together. Doing so makes brittle code, that is difficult to 
				modify, validate and understand. It is cleaner to create external xml files that are
				transformed at runtime, using parameters set through Transformer.setParameter.</li>

			<ul>
				<li><b>[STS] Spurious Thread States</b><br/>
				Finds methods that call wait, notify or notifyAll on an instance of a 
				java.lang.Thread. Since the internal workings of the thread is to synchronize on the
				thread itself, introducing client calls will confuse the thread state of the object
				in question, and will cause spurious thread state changes, either waking threads up
				when not intended, or removing the thread from the runnable state.</li>
				<li><b>[NAB] Needless Autoboxing</b><br/>
				Finds methods that pass an instance of a primitive wrapper class, to a constructor
				of the same class. Since wrapper classes are immutable, you can just use the original
				instance, instead of creating a new one. This bug is a misuse of autoboxing.</li>
				<li><b>[USBR] UnnecessaryStoreBeforeReturn</b><br/>
				Finds methods that store the return result in a local variable, and
				then immediately returns that local variable.</li>
				<li><b>[COM] CopiedOverriddenMethod</b><br/>
				Finds methods that are implemented with an exact copy of their super class method's 
				implementation. In most cases, this means that this method can just be removed.</li>

				<li><b>[SMII] Static Method Instance Invocation</b><br/>
				Finds methods that make static method calls using an instance reference.
				For documentation purposes, it is better to call the method using the class name.
				This may represent a change in definition that should be noticed.</li>
				<li><b>[AFBR] Abnormal Finally Block Return</b><br/>
				Finds methods that return or throw an exception from a finally block. Since a finally block is 
				executed after any return or throw statements that are present in the try or catch block, these exit
				values are swallowed by the finally block's actions.</li>
				<li><b>[NCMU] Non Collections Method Use</b><br/>
				Finds calls to collections objects using methods that are not defined in the Collections interfaces,
				but that have equivalent methods defined in such. By using the new methods, it allows for the 
				replacement of concrete classes with interfaces, and simplifies changing collection types if 
				desired.</li>
				<li><b>[CAO] Confusing Autoboxed Overloading</b><br/>
				Finds classes that define overloaded methods where the only difference is a parameter being
				of type java.lang.Character, and int, long, float or double. Due to autoboxing, one might conclude 
				that a parameter of 'a' would autobox to Character, but would instead be cast to a double.</li>

				<li><b>[FP] Final Parameters</b><br/>
				Finds parameters that could be marked as final, but aren't. Doing so helps document the method, keeps
				unwanted changes to creep in, and may help the jvm jit compiler to optimize better.</li>
				<li><b>[ACEM] Abstract Class Empty Methods</b><br/>
				Finds empty methods, or methods that just throw an exception in abstract classes. In these cases, it
				probably is more correct to just define the method to be abstract as well, so that proper subclass
				implementation is enforced.</li>
				<li><b>[MAC] Manual Array Copy</b><br/>
				Finds methods that copy elements from one array to another manually using a loop. It is better 
				performing to use System.arraycopy, as this method is native.</li>
				<li><b>[FPL] Floating Point Loops</b><br/>
				Finds methods that use floating point variables as the index to loops. Since floating point math is inprecise,
				errors will accumulate each time through the loop, making the logic suspect. It is better to use an 
				integer index, and calculate the desired floating point value from this integer.</li>

				<li><b>[PL] Parallel Lists</b><br/>
				Finds classes that maintain two or more lists or arrays that appear to share a one-to-one relationship
				through a common index. It is usually better to create a separate class that holds all corresponding attributes,
				and add instances of this class to just one list or array.</li>
				<li><b>[DLC] Dubious List Collection</b><br/>
				Finds fields that are implementations of java.util.List, but that are used in a set-like fashion.
				Since lookup type operations are performed using a linear search for Lists, the performance for large
				Lists will be poor. Consideration should be made as to whether these fields should be sets.</li>
				<li><b>[PCOA] Partially Constructed Object Access</b><br/>
				Finds constructors that call non-final methods in non-final classes. If this class is derived from, and the
				method is overridden, then that method will be executing on an object that hasn't been constructed in regards 
				to the subclass implementation. These methods should probably be defined as final.</li>
				<li><b>[LSC] Literal String Comparison</b><br/>
				Finds methods that call the equals or compareTo methods on a String variable passing in a String literal.
				A NullPointerException may occur if the string variable is null. If instead the method was called on
				the string literal, and the variable was passed as an argument, this exception could never happen</li>

				Finds parameters to methods that are defined as concrete classes, 
				when they're usage pattern can be defined by an implemented interface. 
				By switching to the interface, you can reduce coupling, which helps making
				the code more testable and changeable.</li>
				<li><b>[LII] List Indexed Iterating</b><br/>
				Looks for uses of using loop indexed variables to 'iterate' over a List by calling get(i) 
				each time thru the loop. Depending on the List implementation, using Iterators can be 
				significantly faster. Using Iterators also makes it easier to substitute other collection types.</li>
				<li><b>[UCC] Unrelated Collection Contents</b><br/>
				Looks for collections that hold objects that are unrelated by class or interface inheritance, other 
				than java.lang.Object. Doing so, leads to brittle code, either by 'encoding' type knowledge in the position
				of an element, or using instanceof tests. It is usually better to create a separate class, add the individual
				types as members to it, and add an instance of this class to the collection.</li>
				<li><b>[DRE] Declared Runtime Exception</b><br/>
				Finds methods that declare RuntimeExceptions in their throws clause. While not illegal,
				this may indicate a misunderstanding as to how unchecked exceptions are handled.
				If is felt that a RuntimeException is so prevalent that it should be declared, it 
				is probably a better idea to prevent the occurance in code.</li>
