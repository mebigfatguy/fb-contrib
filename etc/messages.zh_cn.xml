            Doing so makes for brittle code, relying either on positional correspondence for type, or a reliance on instanceof to determine type.

            While doing so is not illegal, it may represent a misunderstanding as to the exception in question.

            <p>此方法使用<code>StringBuffer</code>或<code>StringBuilder</code>的 append() 拼接字符串。

            <p>
            Java 会隐式使用 StringBuilders，这令此很难被侦测修复。
            比如，<br/>
<pre><code>
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
for (Map.Entry<Integer, String> e : map.entrySet()) {
    sb.append(e.getKey() + e.getValue());        //在这里 bug 被侦测到
}
</code></pre><br/>

            会被自动转换为：<br/>
<pre><code>
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
for (Map.Entry<Integer, String> e : map.entrySet()) {
    StringBuilder tempBuilder = new StringBuilder();
    tempBuilder.append(e.getKey());
    tempBuilder.append(e.getValue());
    <b>sb.append(tempBuilder.toString());</b>        //低效
}
</code></pre><br/>

            这里多用了一个临时的<code>StringBuilder</code>，完全是没必要的。
            为防止这种情况发生，只需要：<br/>

<pre><code>
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
for (Map.Entry<Integer, String> e : map.entrySet()) {
    sb.append(e.getKey());
    sb.append(e.getValue());
}

...
System.out.println("Problem with the object :" + someObj);

            <p>此方法在只实现接口或父类的方法的情况下，用具体的类作为入参。

                参数 list 被定义为<code>ArrayList</code>，一个<code>List</code>接口的具体实现。
                这里没必要特别指定<code>ArrayList</code>，因为我们没有用到任何<code>ArrayList</code>特定的方法(像<code>ensureCapacity()</code>或<code>trimToSize()</code>)。

<pre><code>

        <![CDATA[
        <p>此方法使用Arrays.asList(foo)构建一个列表，传入一个元素。
        Arrays.asList首先需要从这个元素创建一个数组，然后构建一个包装该数组的List。
        使用Collections.singletonList(foo)会更简单，它不会创建数组，并且会生成一个简单得多的List实例。
        由于这两个数组都是不可变的(从List的角度来看)，从使用角度来看，它们是等效的。
        </p>
        <p>您应该注意Array.asList和Collections.singletonList之间的区别。
        允许将很少使用的set(index，value)方法与Array.asList创建的List一起使用，但不能与Collections.singletonList一起使用。
        因此，如果确实需要使用set(index，value)方法，请继续使用Arrays.asList。
